    Create an array arr3[] of size n1 + n2.
    Simultaneously traverse arr1[] and arr2[]. 
        Pick smaller of current elements in arr1[] and arr2[], copy this smaller element to next position in arr3[] and move ahead in arr3[] and the array whose element is picked.
    If there are remaining elements in arr1[] or arr2[], copy them also in arr3[].
